# Custom ES-Lint rules for Svelte & SvelteKit

This is a WIP collection of custom ESLint rules for Svelte and SvelteKit projects inspired by common (and sometimes annoying) mistakes we do and probably can be avoided with some code linting.
The main goal is to create a more consistent and predictable development experience, and less time spend on code review.
 
The rules are very strict by default and can be configured with an extra options object to make them less strict, more flexible, or completely disabled. [WIP]
